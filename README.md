# KLayoutPhotonicPCells-core
KLayoutPhotonicPCells core Package

This package extends KLayout with photonic PCells. Namely it provides the possibility to create ports. Ports in comparison to pins of electronics have additionally to the position also a direction and length. Furthermore, this package allows to build hierarchical PCells. These allow instantiating other PCells and connect them via ports or position them relativ to the coordinate system of the parent PCell.

The full pdf-documentation is in the [doc](https://github.com/sebastian-goeldi/KLayoutPhotonicPCells-core/blob/master/doc/build/latex/KLayoutPhotonicPCells.pdf) folder. Otherwise, the full documentation can be found as a sphinx website at doc/build/html/index.html .
